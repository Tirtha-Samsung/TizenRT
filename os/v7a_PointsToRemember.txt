This is a temporary file to keep track of the adjustments made to build v7-a architecture

##########################################################################################
Armv7-a Architecture
-> Code ported from Nuttx
-> Kconfigs updated in arch/arm/src and arch/arm/src/armv7-a/src
-> While building v7A, if AmebaD is used as the basis, then v8-m toolchain
   has "-mcmse" flags which need to be removed because they are specifically for v8-m
   security xtensions and are not applicable to v7-a.

-> MMU, PAGING, Virtual Address Environments need to be taken care of


##########################################################################################
Board/Chip Specific files
-> RTL8730E - Arm CortexA32
   Code files have been creaed by replicating rtl8721csm (amebad) and making changes
   as and when necessary. More references may require change later.
-> A1X - PCDUINO_A10 - Arm CortexA8
   Chip code files imported from Nuttx and fit into TizenRT.
   We do not expect to support this chip.



#########################################################################################
Major mmissing configs and files

-> These 2 are not present in TizenRT
CONFIG_RAM_VSTART=0x4a000000
CONFIG_RAM_START=0x4a000000
Added directly to the defconfig of a1x/tash as of 27 March 23

-> The below macro is not getting defined
NUTTX_TEXT_SIZE macro definition in hardware/some_map.c is a problem
For some reason this file does not define the TEXT_SIZE macro which is dependant on
two other macro defninitions in the file. Has been hardcoded as of 27 March 23

->cache.h missing in os/include/tinyara
Needs to be added board specific in os/arch/arm/src/armv7-a and include references
need to be changed to include "cache.h" from include <tinyara/cache.h>
The file has been created by replicating and renaming armv7-r/cache.h as of 27 March 23

->kernel/sched folder requires changes for SMP
Nuttx defines SMP configs in nuttx/sched/Kconfg
TizenRt dos not have a kernel/sched/Kconfig yet

-> arch/arm/src/armv7-a/syscall.h was missing
Hasbeen copied from armv7-r code for the timebeing
Reference used in arch/arm/include/syscall.h

-> arch/arm/src/armv7-a/arm_ssert.c file is missing
Added the file with dummy code for handling asserts
